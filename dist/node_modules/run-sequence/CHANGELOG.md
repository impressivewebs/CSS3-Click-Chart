### Possible Breaking Change in version 1.0.0

In version 1.0 I've added a check that prevents the same task from showing up within any sequence.  This is to help reduce typo errors, as well as prevent the [silent exit bug when the same task occurred twice in a parallel sequence](https://github.com/OverZealous/run-sequence/issues/13).  The sequence will now fail immediately during the validation stage.

If this breaking change affects you, you'll need to take one of several actions:

1. Remove duplicate tasks if they are a mistake.
2. Filter unneeded duplicate tasks before passing them to `run-sequence`.
3. Rewrite your tasks or wrap your tasks within functions that can be called multiple times if for some reason you rely on this functionality.
4. Continue using `run-sequence` version 0.3.7 if it was working for you.

## Older

I'm not going to go through the old history at this point.
